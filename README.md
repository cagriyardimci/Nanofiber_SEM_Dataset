Project Overview
This repository contains the source code and dataset necessary to replicate the results of the research paper:
"Automated Defect Classification of Electrospun Polyacrylonitrile Nanofibers via Deep Learning of SEM Images"

Abstract
This study presents a deep learning-based framework for automated defect detection in electrospun Polyacrylonitrile (PAN) nanofibers using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images. The proposed Nanofiber Classifier model is trained on a dataset consisting of three categories:

Slightly Defective
Defective
Non-Defective

Dataset
The dataset used in this study is publicly available:
ðŸ“‚ Nanofiber SEM Dataset: Figshare Repository

The dataset consists of 2 main folders and 3 subfolders: Training_Dataset and Test_Dataset with 3 categories mentioned above.

The images were preprocessed using a bilateral filter, followed by data augmentation techniques.
